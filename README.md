# Mapping_Earthquake

# Overview 
The purpose of this project is to visually show the differences between the magnitude of earthquakes all over the world for the last seven days. We also added on tectonic plates that are present in the world to show how earthquakes tend to fall close to the lines. We accomplish this by diving into more advanced JavaScript, Leafplot, and the D3.js library to plot the data on a Mapbox map through an API request and create a visualization to map earthqake data by latitude and longitude from the USGS.
